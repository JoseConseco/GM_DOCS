Usually increasing triangulation resolution parameters fixes that. Installation # Edit \u2192 User Preferences \u2192 Add-ons tab, press ' Install ' button, in bottom bar. Remember to press 'Save Preferences' , so that addon stays enabled after restarting blender. When you are updating addon, usually it is good to remove old version by using 'Remove' button (visible on image above), before installing new version.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#garment-maker-documentation","text":"Garment Maker is Blender addon designed to simplify process of generating cloth sewing patterns directly inside Blender.

To create garment click +(Plus) icon, in the Garment Maker Panel . More settings will popup, containing all the properties of T-shirt (sewing patterns, sewings, pins etc). Use 'Edit Sewings' button (chain icon) in the Sewings box (see video below). 'Edit Sewings' is modal operator, that will let you define sewings sewings between 2d > curves (you can add, remove, change existing sewings, flip sewing direction). Press Enter / Spacebar to accept them sewings. Notice - all the 2d curves, that were connected with sewings, are automatically assigned to the Garment Sewing Patterns list. You can now convert T-Shirt to 3d mesh, with 'Convert to mesh cloth' button. New collection will be created named: Generated + garment_name From now on output mesh can be simulated using Blenders build in cloth sim. Enable 'Use Bend Deformer' for both sleeves patterns, so that they will wrap around the character arms. Notice - GMaker automatically creates and assigns vertex groups for each 2d pattern. Often when simulating, the gravity will pull the cloth too fast to earth, so that generated T-shirt won't have time to stick to character. To avoid that, you can use 'Initialize Sim Setup' button -> it will animate the gravity strength from 0 to 9,8 m/s^2 over the 'Sim Time' time. it will also animate the sewing force, and the 'Max Shrinking' property (if used). Usually when simulating you should increase the cloth 'Quality Steps' above 15, to prevent cloth going through body surface, and decrease the collision distance to around 0.002. The collision distance should be reduced also on the body of character. When you are satisfied with the simulation result you can: Save the bake into the shape key with 'Save to shape key' button.
