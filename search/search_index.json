Usually when simulating you should increase the cloth 'Quality Steps' above 15, to prevent cloth going through body surface, and decrease the collision distance to around 0.002. The collision distance should be reduced also on the body of character. When you are satisfied with the simulation result you can: Save the bake into the shape key with 'Save to shape key' button.
